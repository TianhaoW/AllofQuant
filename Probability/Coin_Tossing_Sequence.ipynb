    "Suppose we are tossing a fair coin. What is the expected number of steps until\n",
    "we get the coin sequence `HHTHH`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a betting game where a gambler bets on whether the next coin toss will\n",
    "be heads or tails. The gambler either loses all bet or doubles it with each\n",
    "correct prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose in the $i$-th round of the game, gambler $i$ starts with only 1 dollar.\n",
    "They bet all their money in the current and subsequent rounds, following the\n",
    "target coin sequence. A gambler stops betting either when they win the full\n",
    "sequence or lose all their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X_n^i$ represent the money gambler $i$ has after round $n$. Define:\\\n",
    "$$ S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_n^i $$\n",
    "as the total money of all gamblers after round $n$, with $S_0 = 0$. It can be\n",
    "shown that $S_n - n$ is a martingale with respect to the natural filtration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the stopping time $T$ as the first time a gambler wins the entire\n",
    "sequence. We can show that $\\mathbb{E}[T] < \\infty$. By the **Optional Stopping\n",
    "Theorem** (or **Wald's Identity**), we have:\\\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{E}[S_T - T] = \\mathbb{E}[S_0 - 0] = 0. $$\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\mathbb{E}[S_T]. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, when a \"lucky\" gambler wins the full sequence, all gamblers who\n",
    "started betting before this winner lose all their money, or they would be the \"\n",
    "lucky\" gambler. The lucky gambler accumulates a total of $2^5 = 32$ dollars upon\n",
    "winning the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the next gamblers betting on `HHTH` (the first 4 letters of `HHTHH`)\n",
    "lose to the actual sequence `HTHH` (the last 4 letters of `HHTHH`). Similarly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next gambler betting `HHT` loses to `THH`.\n",
    "- The next gambler betting `HH` wins, accumulating $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\n",
    "  dollars.\n",
    "- Finally, the last gambler betting `H` wins $1 \\cdot 2 = 2$ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up:\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\mathbb{E}[S_T] = 32 + 4 + 2 = 40.\n",

    "### Fair Dice Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are tossing a fair dice. What is the expected number of tosses until\n",
    "we get the dice sequence `111`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a similar strategy as in the previous problem. However, the key\n",
    "difference is that a gambler now only has a $1/6$ chance to win in a given\n",
    "round. Consequently, $S_n - n$ is no longer a martingale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we modify the game rules so that the gambler receives **6 times\n",
    "their bet** if they win. Specifically, the dynamics are given by:\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{n+1}^i =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "6 X_n^i & \\text{ if the gambler wins the game,} \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{ if the gambler loses the game.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this adjustment, we see\n",
    "that $\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}^i \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = X_n^i$, which implies\n",
    "that $X_n^i$ is a martingale with initial value $1$. Consequently, $S_n - n$\n",
    "becomes a martingale centered at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this framework, we calculate the expected number of tosses until a gambler\n",
    "wins the sequence `111`:\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\mathbb{E}[S_T] = 6^3 + 6^2 + 6 = 258.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Unfair Coin Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are tossing an unfair coin with probability $p = 0.2$ to toss a\n",
    "head.\n",
    "What is the expected number of tosses until we get the coin sequence `HTH`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the same strategy to construct a martingale. We consider the betting\n",
    "game with dynamics given by \\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{n+1} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{p} X_n & \\text{if the gambler wins on head} \\\\\n",
